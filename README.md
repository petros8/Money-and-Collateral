# Money-and-Collateral
An independent personal research I undertook in 2020. Related to financial plumbing and the systemic role of collateral in the financial system.
This research is essentially the culmination/results of the independent studying I have been doing around the structure of the monetary system and the 2008 financial crisis. 2008 unveiled the systemic role of many markets where data is rarely captured, either due to lack of supervision, outdated accounting frameworks or simply inability due to their bilateral nature. Bibliography around shadow banking provides a novel "worldview" of modern money which better explains how modern financial institutions create liquidity. Evidently, this new approach, if assumed to be accurate, has many implications for the events of 2008: This one event, followed by a series of "Dollar Shortages" during the followng decade, can be perceived as a muti-market bank run, where money takes a variey of implicit -and unexpected- forms.
After studying this bilbiography and other relevant topics, I come up with a looser version of the money supply that is more tolerant towards new financial products, and I explain why collateral has money-like properties by diving deep into the workings of the repo market.
Finally, I test whether some indicator of global financial liqudiity can be used to predict T-bill rates while interpreting the results and explaining the data limitations for the creation of such models.
